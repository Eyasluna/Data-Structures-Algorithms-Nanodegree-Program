The requirement to create an efficient algorithm that searches into this encapsulated structure, like a
Matryoshka dolls as been satisfied by a __recursive algorithm__. 

The time complexity of this algorithm is dependant on the number of iterations that are launched. Being in this case
dependent on __encapsulation of groups__ and __number of users__ of folders, resulting in a __O(g*u)__. As for the 
_space complexity_, it is directly dependent on the number of returns the function does, hence, in this case __O(1)__.
