Task0: run time: O(1)
        One straight forward constant run time.

Task1: run time: O(N+N) = O(N)
        Two for loops. Counted as one O(N)

Task2: run time:O(N)
        One straight forward for loop.

Task3: Part A run time: N+N+N+N+N+N+1+nlogn= 6N+ nlogn  O(nlogn).
        Since I used sorted() function here so the run time for this part is O(nlogn)

       Part B run time: O(N)

Task4: run time:
        Three for loops plus one sorted() function so the total run time is O(nlogn)
